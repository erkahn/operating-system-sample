# operating-system-sample
This is simple operating system for running on "only" Virtual Box 
Those codes are based on Kerim Basol's Keros OS Project
I edit this project for using on Linux.
I'm gonna write how to compile it on Terminal and run it with VirtualBox

Step 1: First you must export those C file's outputs. 
For this write on Terminal: gcc "filename.c"

Step 2: When .c files executed correctly you must makefile them
Command makefile to make it obviously.

Step 3: Now you must configure Virtual Box.
First you click "New" button. I know what a surprise ha?! 
Then you name your os and choose its type: "Other" and version: "Other/Unknown"
On the next step you gonna choose how much mem'ry that os gonna use.
I believe 64 Mbyte is quite enough. That's it create your disk.

Step 4: Click setting your disk -Storage-Delete current Controller create new
floppy controller and choose the makefiled floppy image. then RUN. 

Step 5: Enjoy your new Operating System.
